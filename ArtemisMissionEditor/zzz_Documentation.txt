  1. Wierd programming style and the idea behind it.

Certain interactions in this editor were done in a way that, looking back, was not that well thought out.
For example, MainForm's two main TreeViews's interaction with the Mission class, 
as well as SpaceMapForm's map control and property grids interaction with the PanelSpaceMap class.

The classes link directly to the UI elements (tooltips, labels, menustrips) and change their properties.

The idea was that the logic that belongs to the class stays in the class. 
So, for example, instead of writing the code to Save the Mission in the "OnClick", it's written in the Mission.
However, this logic cannot be easilly separated from the UI. 
For example, when amount of object on SpaceMap changes, it must be reflected in the UI tooltip. 
Therefore, class logic had to operate on UI, and therefore, it was done the way it is done.

Looking back, maybe this was I could have written it differently with events. 
So that everything that should be changed in the UI is gotten from public properties of related classes, and
those classes would then fire events that these properties changed, and thus UI would update.

Then again, editing huge missions, it would be ridiculous to re-fill the whole contents of TreeView every time
something in the mission changed. Which means keeping the mission data in the TreeView control remains a good
idea. But if that is so, then how do we get rid of the fact that Mission class directly operates on TreeView 
control, storing its data in the control itself?

In any case, I hope this explanation helps anyone who wants to contribute to the project to understand how and
why it was done this way. And if you have ideas on how to fix it - meaning, how to rewrite everything, 
so that classes stay more isolated and do not access each other directly, 
then you're welcome to contact me at starsabre@gmail.com. There may be a common pattern I'm missing here 
or something else, but I am clueless as to how to rewrite this better.


  2. How is the Mission stored and edited?

After mission file is read from Xml, it is separated into Nodes. 
Nodes in turn are separated into Statements.
Mission-level Commentaries, Start, Event and Folder Xml Elements are all Nodes. 
MissionNode and inherited classes are used to represent the Nodes. 

MissionNode class contains lists of Actions and Conditions (and node-level commentaries) which are all Statements.
MissionStatement and inherited classes are used to represent the Statements.

The list of Nodes that reperesent the mission are actually stored in the Tag property 
of the TreeViewNode class in the TreeViewEx control used to display mission nodes (the left one).
In order to link to those, Mission class contains refernces to the control.

So, when you edit nodes in the left TreeView (add/remove/etc.) you edit the list of mission nodes directly. 

Mission statements are output into the TreeView on the right when selected mission node is changed.
TreeView nodes are created and MissionStatement classes are assigned into the Tag property.

When you edit nodes in the right TreeView (add/remove), MissionStatement lists in MissionNode class 
that represents the node are re-read from the TreeView.
When you edit statements themselves, the referenced MissionStatement class is edited directly.


  3. How Copy/Paste, Undo/Redo works?

In order to Undo/Redo the same technique is used as in order to Copy/Paste: Xml.

When change is done, mission is saved to Xml and compressed and stored. 
When you Undo/Redo, mission is simply read from this Xml, and then gui stuff is applied: 
for example, what node and statement was selected etc.

Copy places all selected nodes/statements into buffer as text. 
Paste removes excessive elements if they are present and then embeds the contents into root element.
For example, if you paste statements into a Node, then "<event>" elements are removed.
Result is then parsed as an Xml file and the result Nodes/Statements are added into mission.


  4. How is a statement transformed into its visual representation and converted into the GUI form?

In order to be able to both display and edit a statement, we must parse it and split it into parts. 

For example, we split <create type="anomaly" use_gm_position="" /> into: 
- Create
- anomaly
- at GM position
- with name
- <name>

Now we can edit the value or the name separately, and present it in a humanly readable way: 
"Create anomaly at GM position with name <name>"

The way this is done:

Each statement is parsed by doing a series of branching decisions:
- first we decide, wether the statement is a condition, action or a comment (in our case it's an action)
- next we decide, what kind of action the statement is (it's a "create" action)
- next we decide, what kind of create action it is (it's a "create anomaly" action)
- next we decide, wether we create anomaly at location or at GM position (it's GM position)

Finally, we arrive at a parsed statement (called "Expression"). 
It contains an array of expression members, which can be all be put one next to another 
in order to construct the text string for the statement.

Each time we edit something (any value within a statement), the process repeats. 

Say if we want to have a point, not GM position, we will set "use_gm_position" value to null, 
which will make the check for GM position to decide it's not a GM position but a point
Or we can change the action type - and the expression will change dramatically.


  5. How this works in terms of code.

All the data for the statement is stored in the MissionStatement class. 
Attributes are stored in form of a Dictionary<string, string>. Body and name are stored separately.
Other members provide functionality to calculate common things like:
- "is this a Create statement" (can it be edited on SpaceMap)
- "is this an Action"
- etc.

MissionStatement.Expression contains a List<ExpressionMemberContainer>.
It is populated when MissionStatement.Update() is called.
It contains the sequence of members that constitute the parsed statement.

MissionStatementContainer links together two classes:
- MissionStatement (contains the data)
- ExpressionMember (contains the logic about this member)
This way, we can use the same ExpressionMember class everywhere.

ExpressionMember is a building block of an Expression. 
For example, in the above example, "anomaly" is an Expression member, as well as "at side" and "name" and so on.

An ExpressionMember can either be a "Check" or not.
- If not, it's somehow used as a building block in an expression 
(either just filler text, like "with name", or editable value, like "x")
- If it's a check, then it is not acutally stored in XML, and sometimes is not even displayed 
in the text representation of the statement, but rather used to branch.
In this case it's a ExpressionMemberCheck class which as a list of PossibleExpressions and a Decide method. 
PossibleExpressions contain the possible List<ExpressionMembers> that can branch from this check. 

For example, in ExpressionMemberCheck_Point_GM, a check for point or GM position, there will be two entries:
- one for point (it will contain ExpressionMembers for "at point" "X," "Y," "Z") 
- and one for GM (it will contain ExpressionMembers for "selected by GM" and an invisible member 
  that sets the flag in xml).
Decide() method makes the decision which of the possible expressions is used. 
It contains the logic that tells it how to make the decision.
For example, in case of point or GM position check, it will look at wether the "selected_by_GM" value is set.
If the value is set, it decides that this is a "selected by GM" case, and if not, "at point" case.

ExpressionMember class is used in the structure that defines the allowed mission xml syntax. 
It's not actually used to represent specific instances of the expression members.
For that purpose, ExpressionMemberContainer class is used.

The way ExpressionMembers define the allowed mission syntax is as follows:

* ExpressionParser.Root contains the root ExpressionMember, of the ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNode_H class. 
This class is a check responsible for deciding wether the expression is a Commentary, Action or Condition. 
Therefore, it's PossibleExpressions (defined in the constructor) contain three lists of one check each:
 - Commentary
 - Action 
 - Condition
It's Decide simply looks at what Type the statement has and thus decides wether it's a commentary or action.

* Every "main" check class for Action and Condition has a big list of PossibleExpressions. 
They are called ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNameAction and ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNameCondition
The constructor of these two classes contains the bulk of the syntax logic. It branches most of the commands.

* Every additional branching is done through other classes that also inherit ExpressionMemberCheck. 
The constructor defines the exact ExpressionMembers added by the check, 
the Decide() method defines how the check makes it's choice, 
while SetValueInternal() defines how does the check enforce it's choice if it's a user-changeable.
For example, in case of "point or GM pos" choice, when the user choses "point", 
SetValueInternal() will clear the "use_gm_position" variable,
while if the user choses "gm pos", then it will set that variable.

Therefore, code in constructors, Decide and SetValueInternal method of all the ExpressionMember classes together 
defines the syntax and the parsing logic. 


  6. An example: parsing <create type="anomaly" use_gm_position="" />

1) MissionStatement.Update() is called. 
   This function, amongst other things, constructs the expression.

2) ExpressionParser.ConstructExpression() is called. 
   This function begins the recursive construction by calling the first Append() with the Root ExpressionMember.

3) ExpressionParser.Append() is called for the first time. 
   This function appends the Root ExpressionMember to the statement. 
   Since it is a check, it will decide what to add next.

4) ExpressionMemberCheck.Decide() is called on Root (class ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNode_H).
   It decides wether the Statement is a Comment, Condition or Action.
   Depending on what it is, next check is added.

5) ExpressionParser.Append() is called for the second time.
   This time, Comment, Condition or Action's main check is added. 
   If it's not a comment, it will decide what kind of condition/action it is.
   Since this is Action, we add the action's main check.

6) ExpressionMemberCheck.Decide() is called on class ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNameAction.
   It decides what to add next. It checks the element name, sees "create" 
   and thus chooses ExpressionMemberCheck_CreateType_H

7) ExpressionParser.Append() is called for the third time.

8) ExpressionMemberCheck.Decide() is called on class ExpressionMemberCheck_CreateType_H
   This time, we decide what kind of object is being added. Since it's an anomaly, 
   we add more than one ExpressionMember this time:
   - type (allowing us to choose a type of the object being created)
   - "at " (ust a text string to make the whole statement easier to comprehend)
   - ExpressionMemberCheck_Point_x_GMPos (this is the Check that will either add "point" or "GM pos")
   - "with " (another string)
   - "name " (another string)
   - name (allowing us to edit name of the object)

9) ExpressionParser.Append() is called for the fourth time (for the "type").
   This time it's not a check, so it just adds it and goes on to next on the list.

11) ExpressionParser.Append() is called (for the "at ").
    Again, not a check, go to the next on the list,

12) ExpressionParser.Append() is called (for the ExpressionMemberCheck_Point_x_GMPos)
    This time, decision will be made that again adds multiple ExpressionMembers. 
	They will be processed before we return to processing the next on our current list - "with ".

And so on...


  7. So, where is the parsing logic defined?

Most of the logic is defined in the constructors of the revelant ExpressionMemberChecks.

The most of it is contained in the two main checks:
- ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNameAction's constructor contains all expressions for actions. 
  So, if you need to add a new action, you add it there in the constructor.
  If you need to change expression of one of the actions, you change it in the constructor.
  Etc.
- ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNameCondition's constructor contains all expressions for conditions.
  So, if you need to add a new condition, you add it there in the constructor.
  If you need to change expression of one of the conditions, you change it in the constructor.
  Etc.

The non-branching logic is also defined there. 
For example, "set_to_gm_position" action looks mostly the same, with only small changes. 
Therefore, most of the logic is described in ExpressionMemberCheck_XmlNameAction's constructor.
Branching logic, like "name or gm selection", is described in the relevant classes.
However, "create" action looks vastly different depending on what kind of object is created.
Therefore, all of the logic is described in ExpressionMemberCheck_CreateType's constructor.


  8. Auxillary classes for the Expression:

1) ExpressionMemberValueType
  This class describes the way mission editor treats the value. Basically it's either:
  - Nothing, in which case this is not a value at all, but either a label, check or a derived value
  - Body, which means the value is stored as a multi-line string in the element's body
  - one of the typical Int/Double/Bool etc types

2) ExpressionMemberValueEditor
  This class describes the way mission editor allows to edit the value. 
  By default it will just show a popup dialog, but you can also specify a method that will prepare a dropdown menu.
  This class also contains dictionaries to convert strings between display and xml. 
  This way, for example, you can make "add_ai" value in Xml display as "Add AI command", 
  or make "Default" input string convert into value "0" in Xml.

3) ExpressionMemberValueDescription
  This class describes the way value is treated. It combines the type, the editor, 
  denotes what kind of text is added to the sides of the value,
  for example, quotes, spaces, brackets or maybe a colon on the right, 
  as well as setting boundaries for numeric variables. 
  If you need to add a new kind of value, you add an extra ExpressionMemberValueDescription.
