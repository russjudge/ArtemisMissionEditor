* CODE rework ~ Work-work!
  * Move all static classes to a different static class (like EMVEditors for EMVEditor) so that they don't clutter the class
  * Move PrepareContextMenuStrip functions to other static class?
  * COMMEN-FUCKING-TARY EVERYWHERE IT's MISSING! ESPECIALLY METHODS!
  * Should I switch Coordinates and FakeShields to classes?

* Improve expression parsing:
  - maybe show error/warning text differently? IDK, somehow in a more Visual Studio - style?
  - maybe add autocomplete or such stuff for var names? IntelliSense-style?

* Improve Foolproof check
  - there must be ways to do it :)


TODO's for the DISTANT FUTURE

1. Selection:
* Multiselect with one click (ctrl_click): selecting all nodes between the current and the chosen
* Drag and drop whole selection?

2. Add MANDATORY wherever it is needed by the game

3. [Forgot what this means] Icons for actions? 

4. [Probably pointless] Allow editing set_property statements also on the space map,
The way mission scripting parsing works, you should not set object properties in the statement where you create an object.
Therefore, allowing this would not be worth it.

5. Find a way to make the treeview control never flicker at all no matter how it is resized, while retaining the slider functionality to resize form dimensions


OLD TODOs:

* BUG! Convert comms/etc [Is this bug there anymore? Was it fixed long time ago?...]
* Somehow show how many spaces there are in names consisting only of them [David: Dosen't 1.7 disallow this now?]
* Text description for all properties on space map [Is this done already?]
* Convert to comment/from comment for statements [Is this done already?]
