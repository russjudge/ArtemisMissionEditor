* CODE rework ~ Work-work!

* Improve expression parsing:
  - maybe show error/warning text differently? IDK, somehow in a more Visual Studio - style?
  - maybe add autocomplete or such stuff for var names? IntelliSense-style?

* Foolproof check
  Have an option to highlight problematic events in the mission. Probably as an option "Scan mission for errors" or maybe change event icons and add tooltips? Maybe as an option?
  Check for common mistakes such as:
  - not changing at least one variable that is also in the condition list. 
  - trying to set properties of an object created in the same event
  - wrong paths to files (absolute for sounds, relative for graphics)
  - something else?
  - NOTE: we already have error highlighting. Maybe warning highlighting should be somehow incorporated there

OLD TODOs:

* BUG! Convert comms/etc [Is this bug there anymore? Was it fixed long time ago?...]
* Somehow show how many spaces there are in names consisting only of them [David: Dosen't 1.7 disallow this now?]
* Text description for all properties on space map [Is this done already?]
* Convert to comment/from comment for statements [Is this done already?]



TODO's for the DISTANT FUTURE

1. Selection:
* Multiselect with one click (ctrl_click): selecting all nodes between the current and the chosen
* Drag and drop whole selection?

2. Add MANDATORY wherever it is needed by the game

3. [Forgot what this means] Icons for actions? 

4. [Probably pointless] Allow editing set_property statements also on the space map,
The way mission scripting parsing works, you should not set object properties in the statement where you create an object.
Therefore, allowing this would not be worth it.
